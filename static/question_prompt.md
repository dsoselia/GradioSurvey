# User Task Evaluation Guidelines: Relevance and Helpfulness

Below are responses for the following question from two different models. Please evaluate which of the answers would be more helpful. If you think both answers are equally helpful, please select the last option.

During your evaluation consider the following criteria to judge the more helpful response with.

  
- **Alignment with User's Intent**: Ensure the response directly addresses the user's question or task, interpreting underlying intentions when not explicitly stated. 
-  **Clarity and Precision**: Responses should be easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary jargon and maintaining focus on the user's query. 
-  **Directness and Relevance**: Keep the response strictly related to the task, avoiding unrelated information or tangents. 
- **Efficiency and Brevity**: Provide comprehensive yet concise information, steering clear of repetitive or overly detailed content that does not enhance understanding.
